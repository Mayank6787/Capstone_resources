# Hospital Coverage Analysis System

## A Comprehensive Geospatial Healthcare Accessibility Tool

### 1. Introduction
The Hospital Coverage Analysis System is a sophisticated geospatial analysis tool designed to evaluate and visualize healthcare accessibility across India. The system identifies areas where villages lack adequate hospital coverage, defined as being within a 5-kilometer radius of a hospital. This analysis is crucial for healthcare planning and resource allocation, helping identify underserved areas that require additional healthcare facilities.

### 2. System Architecture

#### 2.1 Data Layer
The system utilizes a JSON-based data structure containing two primary entities:
```json
{
    "hospitals": [
        {
            "Name of Hospital": string,
            "Latitude": float,
            "Longitude": float,
            "Address": string,
            "Contact": string
        }
    ],
    "villages": [
        {
            "name": string,
            "Latitude": float,
            "Longitude": float
        }
    ]
}
```

#### 2.2 Processing Layer
The system implements multiple analytical approaches:
- **Distance Calculation Module:**
  - Utilizes geodesic distance calculations
  - Accounts for Earth's curvature
  - Implements 5km threshold for coverage determination
- **Zone Classification System:**
  - Green Zone: Villages within 5km of a hospital
  - Red Zone: Villages beyond 5km from any hospital
  - Grey Zone: 5km radius around villages without hospital coverage

#### 2.3 Visualization Layer
- Interactive web-based map interface
- Color-coded markers and zones
- Detailed information popups
- Custom legend and controls

### 3. Technical Implementation

#### 3.1 Core Technologies
- Python 3.x
- NumPy for numerical computations
- Folium for map visualization
- Scikit-learn for clustering algorithms
- Shapely for geometric operations
- GeoPy for distance calculations

#### 3.2 Key Algorithms
**Hospital Proximity Analysis:**
```python
def is_near_hospital(village_coord, hospitals):
    for hospital in hospitals:
        distance = geodesic(
            (village_coord[0], village_coord[1]),
            (hospital["Latitude"], hospital["Longitude"])
        ).kilometers
        if distance <= 5:
            return True
    return False
```

**Geographic Boundary Management:**
```python
INDIA_BOUNDS = {
    'min_lat': 6.5546079,
    'max_lat': 35.6745457,
    'min_lon': 68.1113787,
    'max_lon': 97.395561
}
```
